        <p>
          Currently a Work in Progress
        </p>
        <p>
          For my Senior Project, me and some of my friends decided to make a 2D Unity game called Spellcraft.
          For the project, I immersed myself in world design and level creation, mainly focused on developing with Unity's built in Tile palette system.

          Best played in fullscreen.

        <h1>Boss Battle</h1>
        <p>
          This was a small project for a class called Game Development 2D. This was originally meant as just a small assignment for this class, but I decided
          to turn it into my final project for the class, and I feel like it went fairly well
        </p>
        <p>
          I ran into some small issues in converting the assignment from a windows application into a WebGL file due to some form of compression. I eventually got it all worked out,
          and you can play it down below.
