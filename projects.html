              This was my Initial introduction to using API keys to get information
              from the web in an application. if the user said something like "stock price of NVDA"
              , it would get the previous close of NVDA. Also if you say "weather in new york", it would
              say the current weather and the temperature in Celcius.
            </p>

            <p>
              This app DOES work. However, I have had to remove my personal API keys
              that I used for testing. If you want to try it, I got my API keys from 
              OpenWeather and AlphaVantage.

              I have always been a huge fan of the pokemon franchise, so I decided to create a little something for my interest. 
              I am currently working on a project that gets information from PokeAPI about a Pokemon that is searched up by the user
            </p>

            <p>
              In the future, I want this project to be able to be sort of a calculator for competitive players, where you can input your attacking pokemon and the opponents
              defending pokemon, and get a gauge of how much an attack should do based on stat boosts, types, abilities, held items, etc
            </p>
